# HDownloader - A Firefox Extension

Give you a quicker access to the download button of your favorite JAV and Hentai !

## Description

Isn't it annoying to have to wait for your browser to load the images one by one before you can relax? You prefer to download directly and enjoy it later but it requires an extra click? Then this extension is for you! It allows you to access the download button directly from the list!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any IDE that you know how to develop on and that supports JS and HTML
* Internet because you don't need to know how to code, only to copy/paste (I think it's obvious that i'm not a JS developer...)

### Installing

1. Download
2. Extract
3. Access to `aboud:debugging` on Firefox
4. In Temporary extensions, load your `manifest.json` file

(I don't know how to add it permanently, but it should be possible)

### Executing program

* Access to the page once it's installed
